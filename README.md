# 👋 Hello, I'm Suriyah Dhinakaran

🚀 I’m a **Geospatial Data Scientist** working at the intersection of **Earth Observation**, **AI**, and **Big Data**, with a passion for enabling **sustainable environmental development** through open science and digital twin technologies.

🏢 Currently, I work as a **Junior Researcher** at the [Institute for Earth Observation – Eurac Research, Bolzano, Italy 🇮🇹](https://www.eurac.edu/en/institutes-centers/institute-for-earth-observation), where I specialize in **climate data downscaling**, **Earth observation workflows**, and **high-performance environmental computing**.

🧠 My work bridges climate modeling, machine learning, and reproducible research practices. I contribute to international projects like **Horizon Europe – interTwin**, support **ESA-aligned workflows**, and advocate for **FAIR data principles** in environmental modeling.

🎓 I earned my **Master’s degree in Geoinformatics and Spatial Data Science** under the supervision of **Prof. Edzer Pebesma** at the **University of Münster, Germany** 🇩🇪, where I focused on reproducible geospatial workflows and open science. During this time, I contributed to the *Spatio-Temporal Modelling Lab*, extending the open-access book *Spatial Data Science with Applications in R* by developing Python equivalents for broader accessibility.

🎯 **Current Focus**
- 🛠️ Scalable EO workflows with STAC + Zarr + openEO
- 🌡️ Climate downscaling using ML & ESRGAN
- 🔬 Digital twin applications for Earth system modeling
- 🤝 FAIR data, reproducibility, and open science

💼 I lead or contribute to the development of open-source tools such as:

- [`downScaleML`](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/downScaleML) – high-performance ML downscaling for climate data  
  *(main development happens in the [interTwin EU GitLab](https://gitlab.com/intertwin-eu))*

- [`openeo-processes-dask`](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/openeo-processes-dask) – enabling Zarr-native processing and STAC integration  
  *(used in local, scalable EO pipelines)*

- [`raster2stac`](https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/earth_observation_public/raster-to-stac) – automated STAC metadata generation for EO rasters  
  *(developed within the internal GitLab of Eurac Research)*

Most of my **core development takes place on GitLab**, and this GitHub space serves as a **landing page for selected tools, experiments, and community-facing collaborations**.

🧭 **Professional Highlights**
- 💡 Developed a two-stage ML downscaling method improving SEAS5 forecast resolution from ~30km to 1km
- 🛰️ Contributed to ESA’s EOPF Zarr service for Sentinel satellite data
- 🔄 Built `raster2stac`, streamlining metadata generation for FAIR EO data
- 🧪 Presented research at **EGU**, **IEEE IGARSS**, and won hackathons for EO-based ML solutions
